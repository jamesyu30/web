  <p>
    Lions are carnivorous, so they eat <a href="https://kidzfeed.com/what-do-lions-eat/">meat</a>. They are also the apex predator, so they eat a lot of many different species. They mostly eat: buffaloes, rhinoceros, younger elephants, hippopotamus, zebras, giraffes, crocodiles, wild hogs, and antelopes.
