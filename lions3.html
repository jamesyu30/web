    <h2> How Long Do Lions Sleep? </h2>
    <div class="box">
    <p>
      For lions, hunting can be very exhausting. In fact, most of day lions spend their time sleeping. Male lions get 18 to 20 hours of <a href="https://www.sleep.org/sleep-habits-of-lions/">sleep</a> a day while female lions sleep for 15 to 18 hours. 
      However, not all lions sleep that long, some sleep for 14 hours. Lions are nocturnal and sleep mostly during the day under the shade of trees or bushes and hunt at dusk.
